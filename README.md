## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

1.  **Hybrid Persistence Architecture (`LoanForm` & `CreateLoan`):**
    *   Handles complex polymorphic relationships (Assets vs. Consumables) by manually processing form data in `handleRecordCreation` to ensure data integrity.
2.  **Observer Pattern:**
    *   **`LoanObserver`:** Generates unique loan codes (`LN/2024/...`) and handles status transitions.
    *   **`AssetObserver`:** Automatically logs every state change (move, status update) into the `AssetHistory` table.
3.  **Service Layer:**
    *   **`LoanApprovalService`:** Encapsulates business logic for approving/rejecting loans and updating asset statuses.
    *   **`LoanReturnService`:** Manages the complex logic of partial returns and stock restoration.
4.  **Localization (i18n):**
    *   Full support for **Indonesian (ID)** and **English (EN)** via standard Laravel translation files (`lang/id/resources.php`).

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 📦 Inventory Workflow

The system uses **Product** as the master parent table for all items.

1.  **Create Product (Master):**
    *   Go to **Inventory > Products**.
    *   Create a new product (e.g., "MacBook Pro M3" or "RJ45 Connector").
    *   Select the type: **Asset** (Fixed Item) or **Consumable** (Disposable).

2.  **Add Stock/Units:**
    *   **For Assets:** Go to the **Assets** menu (or via Product relations). Register individual units with unique ID/Tag (e.g., `AST-001`, `AST-002`).
    *   **For Consumables:** Go to **Consumable Stocks**. Add stock quantity to a specific location (e.g., "Warehouse A: 500 pcs").

### 🔄 Managing Operations
*   **Assets Operations:**
    *   **Check Out:** Assign a specific Asset ID to an employee.
    *   **Move:** Transfer Asset from one Location/Site to another.
*   **Loan Request:**
    *   Create a Loan for mixed items (1 Laptop + 5 Connectors).
    *   System automatically validates availability.
1. Employees (or Admin acting as one) create a **Loan** request.
2. Add items: Select **Product** -> System detects if it's an **Asset** (shows specific units) or **Consumable** (shows stock qty).
3. **Admin** goes to the Loan record and clicks **Approve**.
4. When returning, click **Return Items** to process full or partial returns.
